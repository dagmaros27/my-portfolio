              I am a computer science student with an analytical mind and a
              passion for problem solving. I take my education seriously, and
              strive to learn as much as I can about the ever-changing field of
              computer science. I love to challenge myself with difficult
              concepts and tasks, especially when doing so helps me to expand my
              skill set.
